The 2015 Plan selections by County in the Health Insurance Marketplaces' purpose is to analyze individuals based on numerous factors that 
determine their eligibility and enrollment in a health care plan. This to reduce the number of individuals in the United States that 
are uninsured. The data population we chose to specifically analyze is based on age group per State and County. We would like to compare
the 2010 census data to this data set in order to evaluate whether all individuals within that population were accounted for. 
By using R studio we expect to visualize the data to show that certain age groups will have a higher coverage rate than others. Through 
the census, the coverage is expected to be proportional to the population. There may also be certain counties which are also expected 
to have low coverage rates.
